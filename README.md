Colour Switcher is a vibrant and challenging puzzle game where you control a ball that changes color based on what it touches. Navigate through each level carefully — your color determines your fate!

🕹️ Gameplay
You control a ball that can collide with paint splashes.


When the ball hits a paint blob, its color changes to that of the paint.


If the ball collides with a wall of a different color, the game is lost.
